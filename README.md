# Real-Time-Face-Blur-Using-MediaPipe-OpenCV
This project uses MediaPipe Face Detection and OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and blur them for privacy protection. It supports both single-image processing and real-time webcam blurring, making it useful for anonymizing faces in videos, streams, or personal photos.
